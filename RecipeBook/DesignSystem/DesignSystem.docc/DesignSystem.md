# ``DesignSystem``

Design system is a part of our system that will help us to reuse code and try to keep a good look of our app Recipes Book, How?
1. We are going to be able to set a text styles and any UI Element style
2. We are going to be able to set our palette of colors
3. We are going to be able to agroup extensions of any UI Element
4. We are applying SOLID here, so it is really good help for our code
5. We are going to be able to reuse block of code
6. We are going to be able to create a custom UI components and reuse it many times as we needed
